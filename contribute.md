Help us make K-9 Mail even better!


## Users

### Translate the app

K9 Mail uses [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/k-9/k9mail/) for translations. As features are added, there is often a need for translators to localise the text accordingly.

## Developers

### Get the source

The [source code](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9) is hosted on GitHub.

### Read the development documents

We maintain documentation on the design of the app in the [development section](https://k9mail.github.io/documentation/development.html) of the documentation and on the [Wiki](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki). Feel free to contribute towards this and read it to guide patches to submit.

If you are new to Android then the [Android Developer site](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html) has lots of helpful resources.

### Finding issues to fix

A number of the issues are marked with the ['beginner'](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner) label indicating they are probably suitable for someone with not much experience of K-9.

### Developing and submitting a patch

* The [BuildingK9](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/BuildingK9) page has information on how to build K-9. It's important you run the tests (especially ones related to code you have directly changed) before submitting your code.
* See the [Code Style](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/CodeStyle) for information on formatting your code so it matches our style.
* See the [Git Guide](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/) for information on using Git and submitting pull requests

## Designers

The design of K-9 is constantly evolving. We have recently started to work on formalising our design guidelines for the app in a [design repository](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9-design).

## Documentation

Like everything else, this manual is the work of volunteers. If you feel it could be improved with information on a certain topic, feel free to contribute by [creating an issue on the website's tracker](https://github.com/k9mail/k9mail.github.io/issues) or submitting a pull request.

# Composing and Sending E-mail

A core part of an e-mail client is of course writing and sending e-mails. 
The 'Compose' screen of K-9 makes this straightforward.

On the action bar are icons for attaching files and sending the e-mail. 
The file attachment action links to an installed file manager if present.

In the compose screen itself, the account the e-mail will be sent from is displayed. 
Tapping on this allows you to select a different [identity](/documentation/identities.html) to send from.

Below the "From" address, the "To" address is initially visible. Tapping the â†“ arrow allows you to add CC and BCC addresses.

Depending on the settings the message body is shown below the subject, along with a reply, if relevant.

Finally at the bottom the default signature is shown. This can be changed in 
[Settings/Account Settings/Manage identities/*Identity*/Signature](/documentation/settings/account.html)

# Accounts

K-9 supports three main types of account at present:

* IMAP
* POP3
* WebDAV

The account set-up wizard will launch automatically after the Welcome Screen. 
For any additional accounts they can be added by going to the accounts menu, 
and then tapping the 'Add account' option in the overflow menu.

You are then prompted for the email address and password. If K-9 recognises 
the hostname, the setup will be automatically configured with the typical server 
connection details. If not, you will be prompted for the account type and then 
the connection details, including the authentication type.

# PGP/MIME Encryption

In K-9 we aim to support OpenPGP, a specification of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), an encryption method developed 
in the early 90s that uses a 'web of trust' to validate certificates.

In previous releases of K-9 Mail we have supported basic integration with 
[Android Privacy Guard (APG)](http://www.thialfihar.org/projects/apg/). 

However with development on the project stalled and with a desire to better support PGP/MIME in the app, 
newer releases move to support [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) via a public API 
which we hope other apps which want to provide PGP key storage can support.

## Open Keychain & APG Usage

### Signing & Encrypting Mail

When an OpenPGP provider has been set-up in the [account settings](/documentation/settings/account.html) a new set of options are shown in the message compose window:

Selecting Sign and Encrypt accordingly allows e-mails to be sent in a verified and secure way (respectively).

### Decrypting & Verifying Signed Mail

Decryption and verification of e-mail is done automatically and corresponding header is shown when viewing the e-mail:

## Open Keychain Usage (Beta)

### Set-up

### Signing & Encrypting Mail

When composing e-mail with OpenKeychain setup and installed a new pad-lock icon 
appears in the top left of the composition screen. The icon represents the type of signing 
and encryption that will be applied to the message.

Tapping the icon leads to dialog that allows you to change between one of four states:

* Never Sign or Encrypt
* Always Sign, Never Encrypt
* Always Sign, Encrypt if posssible.
* Always Sign, Always Encrypt

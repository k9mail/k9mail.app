# Account Settings

Many of the settings in K-9 Mail can be customized for each account, and are therefore located under *Account Settings*. To open them:

* If you're in the account list view, long-tap the account you want to configure, then select *Account settings*.
* If you're in a folder list or message list, open the menu, select *Settings*, then *Account settings* to get to the settings for the current account.

## General Settings

### Account name
Here you can specify the name of the account that is displayed in the account list screen.

### Default account
Check this setting to make this the default account. It will be used whenever you send a message and don't specify an account, e.g. when taping the *Compose* icon in the account list screen or sending a message from another app.

### Account color
Here you can select the color that is used to indicate that a particular message or folder is belonging to the selected account.


## Reading mail

### Always show images
This setting allows you to control when images are automatically downloaded and displayed in the message view and when you have to press the *Show pictures* button first.

Available options:

* No (Always display the *Show pictures* button)
* From contacts (when the sender is in your Contacts)
* From anyone (Never display the *Show pictures* button)

### Mark as read when opened
Uncheck this to not mark messages as read when you open them. 

Independent of what you select here, you can always select *Mark as read* or *Mark unread* from the menu when viewing a message.


## Fetching mail
These settings control how and when mail is fetched for this account.

### Local folder size
Specify the number of messages that will be downloaded for a folder. When new messages are downloaded older messages will be deleted from the device (but not from the server).

This is no hard limit and you can download more messages by pressing *Load up to XX more* at the end of the message list.

### Sync messages from
If you set this to anything other than *any time (no limit)* K-9 Mail will only download messages that are younger than a certain time span. During synchronization K-9 Mail will remove previously downloaded messages that fall outside that range from the device (but not the server).

**Note:** Currently, pressing *Load up to XX more* in the message list doesn't override this setting. That means you won't be able to manually fetch messages older than specified here.

**Note:** This setting is only available for IMAP accounts.

### Fetch messages up to
Set a limit on how much of a message is downloaded during synchronization. When viewing messages larger than this value you will see a button saying *Download complete message* that allows you to download the rest of the message.

### Folder poll frequency
Control the poll frequency from never up to 24 hours.

### Poll folders
Control whether to poll all, 1st Class, 2nd Class or no folders at all.

To learn more about this, read the page [How to use K-9's folder class system](WorkingWithClasses).

### Push folders
Control whether to push all, 1st class, 2nd class or no folders.

To learn more about this, read the page [How to use K-9's folder class system](WorkingWithClasses).

**Note:** This setting is only available for IMAP accounts, because it's the only account type that supports Push.

### Sync server deletions
By default K-9 Mail removes downloaded messages from the device if the message has been deleted from the server. If you uncheck this setting K-9 Mail will keep the downloaded messages.

### When I delete a message
You can control what happens when you delete a message using K-9 Mail.

The following options are available:

* Do not delete on server (only from the device)
* Delete from server
* Mark as read on server (not available for POP3 accounts)

### Erase deleted messages on server
Normally, messages on the server are simply marked for deletion. Here you can control when they are actually deleted (expunged).

Available options:

* Immediately
* When polling
* Manually

**Note:** Some clients can display messages that are marked for deletion and allow you to remove that flag, undeleting them. K-9 Mail currently doesn't support that functionality.

**Note:** This setting is only available for IMAP accounts.

### Incoming server

Please see the section [Configuring the incoming server](Manual-AccountSetup#configuring-the-incoming-server) on the page [Setting up an email account](Manual-AccountSetup) for the available settings.

### Advanced

K-9 Mail supports some advanced settings for IMAP accounts. If you're not familiar with the details of the IMAP protocol you shouldn't change any of these settings. 

#### Poll when connecting for push
When this is enabled K-9 Mail will do a full folder synchronization after establishing a Push connection. Otherwise it will only download new messages.

#### Max folders to check with push
K-9 Mail needs to establish one connection for each folder that is checked via Push. This can quickly add up and exceed the number of concurrent connections your mail server allows you to establish.
This setting is intended as safety mechanism to limit the number of Push connections regardless of how many folders are configured to be checked via Push.

#### Refresh IDLE connection


## Sending mail
These settings control everything related to sending mail.

### Composition defaults
Here you can configure your main identity.

#### Your name
This is the name that will be used in outgoing messages.

#### Your email address
This is the email address that will be used as the sending address for outgoing messages.

#### Bcc all messages to
Here you enter an email address that will receive a copy of all messages you send.

#### Use signature
Enable this to add a signature to all your messages.

#### Signature
Enter the signature text here.

**Note:** You should start the signature with "-- " (dash, dash, space) on its own line. Most email clients will recognize this as start of the signature and e.g. allow stripping the signature when quoting messages in replies.

#### Signature position
Here you can specify where your signature should appear when replying to a message.

Available options are:

* Before quoted text (your text, your signature, quoted text)
* After quoted text (your text, quoted text, your signature)

**Note:** This setting will be ignored if you check the setting *Reply after quoted text*.

### Manage identities
Here you can set up alternative identities consisting of name, email address, *Reply-to* address, and signature.

#### Add an identity
Select *New identity* from the menu to create a new identity.

#### Delete an identity
Long-press the name of an identity in the list of identities, then select *Remove*.

#### Set default identity
Long-press the name of an identity in the list of identities to open a menu that allows you to change the order of identities (*Move up*, *Move down*, *Move to top / make default*). The top-most identity is the default identity that will be used when composing a message from this account.

### Message Format
Here you can configure the message format that is used for outgoing messages.

The following options are available:

* Plain text (you will lose all formatting and inline images of the original message when forwarding/replying to a message; this will only send text/plain parts)
* HTML (keeps images and formatting; will additionally include a text/plain part)
* Automatic (same as *Plain text* when composing new messages; same as *HTML* when replying or forwarding messages)

### Always show Cc/Bcc
Enabling this will always show the text fields to specify CC and BCC recipients in the message composition screen.

### Read receipt
Checking this requests a read receipt for all outgoing messages.

**Note:** This is adding a special header asking the recipient's email client to confirm that the message was received. Some clients (like K-9 Mail) do not support sending answers to this request. Others ask the user for confirmation before sending an answer. So not receiving a read receipt is not a reliable indicator that a message hasn't been read.

### Reply quoting style
Defines your preference for the format in which the quoted text of the message you are replying to will appear from the following options:

* Prefix (like Gmail, Pine) - The quoted text appears below a one line header in the format "Sender's Name <'user@domain.TLD'> wrote:".

     With the prefix option selected 2 additional options will be available:

     * Reply after quoted text - When checked, the original message will appear above the reply you type into the message text box.

     * Quoted text prefix - Defines the character(s) that will precede each line of quoted text. The default is '>'. 

* Header (like Outlook, Yahoo!, and Hotmail) - The quoted text appears below a header that includes the Original Sender, Recipients, Time, and Subject from the original email's message header fields.

### Quote message when replying
Uncheck this if by default you don't want to include the original message in your reply. You will still be able to include the original message by clicking the *Quote message* button in the message composition screen when replying to a message.

### Strip signatures on reply
When this is checked K-9 Mail will try to detect the correspondents signature and remove it when quoting the original message.

### Outgoing server

Please see the section [Configuring the outgoing server](Manual-AccountSetup#configuring-the-outgoing-server) on the page [Setting up an email account](Manual-AccountSetup) for the available settings.


## Folders

### Auto-expand folder
The folder you specify here will be opened when you click on an account in the account list. Set to *-NONE-* when clicking an account should open the folder list.

### Folders to display
Here you can specify what folder classes should be displayed in the folder list. This can also be changed from the *Show folders...* sub-menu in the folder list.

Available options are:

* All
* Only 1st Class folders
* 1st and 2nd Class folders
* All except 2nd Class folders

To learn more about folder classes, read the page [How to use K-9's folder class system](WorkingWithClasses).

### Move/copy destination folders
This setting specifies which folders are displayed when you're asked to pick a destination folder for copy and move operations.

Available options are:

* All
* Only 1st Class folders
* 1st and 2nd Class folders
* All except 2nd Class folders

To learn more about folder classes, read the page [How to use K-9's folder class system](WorkingWithClasses).

### Folders to search
Here you specify what folders are searched when you start a search from the folder list or the account list. Searches from a message list only search messages in that list.

Available options are:

* All
* Displayable (only folders matching *Folders to display*)
* None

### Archive folder
Here you can designate an archive folder. Messages will be moved there when the *Archive* action is used. Selecting *-NONE-* disables the archive functionality for this account.

**Note:** This setting is not available for POP3 accounts.

### Drafts folder
This specifies which folder is used to save message drafts. Select *-NONE-* to disable saving drafts.

**Note:** This setting is not available for POP3 accounts.

### Sent folder
A copy of sent messages is uploaded to this folder. Select *-NONE-* to disable this functionality. Please note that your mail server might save a copy of outgoing messages regardless.

**Note:** This setting is not available for POP3 accounts.

### Spam folder
Here you can designate a spam folder. Messages will be moved there when the *Spam* action is used. Selecting *-NONE-* disables this functionality.

Please note that K-9 Mail does not have a spam filter included. Moving messages to a special spam folder will often train the spam filter on your mail server. If your server doesn't support this, you might as well disable this functionality and just delete messages.

**Note:** This setting is not available for POP3 accounts.

### Trash folder
Messages you delete in K-9 Mail are moved to the folder you specify here. If you select *-NONE-* K-9 Mail will delete messages instead of moving them to a trash folder.

**Note:** This setting is not available for POP3 accounts.


## Storage
### Storage location
This setting lets you choose whether to store email for the selected account using internal storage or external storage (SD card).

Note that this is different to storing the app in external storage. See [What about Froyo "App2SD"](Storage#what-about-froyo-app2sd) for details on why app2sd is not enabled for K-9 Mail.


## Notifications
Here you can specify whether and how you want to be notified of certain events.

### New mail notifications
Enable this if you want K-9 Mail to create a notification each time a new (unread) message is downloaded.

### Include outgoing mail
If this is unchecked K-9 Mail will not create notifications for downloaded messages that were sent by an address from one of your configured identities.

### New mail ringtone
Specify the ringtone for the notification.

### Vibrate
Check this to enable vibration when new mail arrives.

**Note:** Even with this setting unchecked a notification can cause a vibration when you configured a ringtone and your device is switched to vibrate. This is controlled by Android, not K-9 Mail.

### Vibrate patterns
Here you can select a vibration pattern for notifications.

Available options:

* default (300ms off, 200ms on)
* pattern 1 (100ms off, 200ms on)
* pattern 2 (100ms off, 500ms on)
* pattern 3 (200ms off, 200ms on)
* pattern 4 (200ms off, 500ms on)
* pattern 5 (500ms off, 500ms on)

### Repeat vibration
This setting specifies how often the vibration pattern is repeated. Available options are 1-10.

### Blink LED
Check this to blink the LED when new mail arrives.

**Note:** Not all devices have a notification LED. Unfortunately, there is no way for an app to find out if that's the case. So this setting is always visible, even when you can't use it.

### Notification LED color
Here you can select the color the notification LED should blink in.

**Note:** Not all devices allow you to specify arbitrary colors.

### Sync notifications
If this is checked K-9 Mail will display a notification in the status bar as long as it is checking for new mail.

### Notification opens unread messages
When this is enabled and there is more than one new message, K-9 Mail will display a message list containing all unread messages in this account (except those in the *Trash*, *Drafts*, *Spam*, *Outbox*, and *Sent* folders).


## Search
In this section you can enable and configure the behavior of server-side search.

**Note:** This is only available for IMAP accounts.

### Enable server search
Enable this setting to be able to search messages on the server.

Right now K-9 Mail only allows you to perform a remote search after doing a local search in a folder, i.e. starting a search from the folder list or the account list won't let you search the server.

**Note:** Currently only the subject and sender of remote messages are searched.

### Server search limit
Here you can specify how many search results are downloaded.

K-9 Mail will only download the headers of found messages. The message contents are only downloaded after the messasge is opened for viewing.

Available options are: 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, All.


## Cryptography
This section allows you to select a crypto provider that allows you to encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify messages using the OpenPGP standard.

**Note:** Currently only [APG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thialfihar.android.apg) (Android Privacy Guard) and [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) are supported as a crypto provider. Check the [PGP/MIME](/documentation/encryption/pgpmime.html) section for details on how to use it.

### OpenPGP Provider
This allows you to select the crypto provider to use. Right now the only options are *None*, *APG* and *OpenKeychain*

### Auto-sign
Enable this if you want to sign all messages sent with K-9 Mail. You will still be able to override this on a case-by-case basis in the screen to compose a message.

### Auto-encrypt
Enable this if you want to encrypt all messages sent to a contact you have a public key for. You will still be able to override this on a case-by-case basis in the screen to compose a message.

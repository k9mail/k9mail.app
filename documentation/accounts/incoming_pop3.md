# POP3 Server Settings

TODO: Add POP settings here rather than just say it's similar 

[POP3](/documentation/accounts/pop3.html) mailbox setup is almost identical to 
[IMAP](/documentation/accounts/incoming_imap.html), except that there is no path prefix, 
folder subscription, or compression available, and the port numbers are *110* for 
non-secure and *995* for secure connections. 

After the server settings are checked you can now continue to 
[configure the outgoing server](/documentation/accounts/add.html#outgoing-server).

# Encryption

Communication security is an increasingly important subject. K-9 Mail aims to provide intuitive e-mail security in many forms, 
both in terms of <a href="accounts/authentication.html">supporting secure login to your e-mail server</a> 
and in the security of the e-mail itself.

To this end, K-9 Mail has had longstanding support for PGP/MIME (OpenPGP) and future plans to support S/MIME.

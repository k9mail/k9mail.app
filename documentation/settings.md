# Settings

In K-9 Mail, settings are grouped under *Program-wide Settings*, *Account Settings* and *Folder Settings*. Which of these you can access via the Menu button depends on where you are within the app.

In addition to the screens used to compose and view messages, K-9 Mail has three main list views, which provide access to settings as follows:

* **Accounts:** A list of your e-mail accounts, plus special items that apply across multiple accounts, such as Unified Mailbox and All messages. Press *Menu*, then *Settings* to open the *Global Settings*.
* **Folders:** A list of the folders under a selected account. Press *Menu*, *More*, then *Settings*, and you'll get a choice of *Global Settings* and *Account Settings*.
* **Messages:** A list of messages in a selected folder. Press *Menu*, *More*, then *Settings*, and you'll get a choice of *Global Settings*, *Account Settings* and *Folder Settings*.

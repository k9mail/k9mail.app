## Installation

Once you have obtained the APK file from <a href="/download.html">one of the app stores</a> it will be installed 
automatically. Depending on the version of Android you have you may be prompted to accept K-9's use of permissions.

## Permissions

K-9 Mail requests the following:

* Contacts - This allows K-9 Mail to auto-suggest contacts and to allow you to add new senders to contacts via the app
* Photos / Media / Files - This allows you to attach images and save images you receive
* Storage - K-9 needs to store e-mail and attachments to your device in order to function
* Vibration control - Offer the ability to vibrate when receiving an e-mail
* Run at start-up - This allows you to receive e-mail as soon as you turn your device on
* Prevent the device from sleeping - This allows push and poll e-mail to work
* View network connections - This allows K-9 Mail to only make requests when a connection is available
* Read sync settings - This allows syncing contacts and other information
* Full network access - Needed in order to contact your mail server

More permissions may be added to support new features and development.

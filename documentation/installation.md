## Installation

Once you have obtained the APK file from <a href="download.html">one of the app stores</a> it will be installed 
automatically. Depending on the version of Android you have you may be prompted to accept K-9's use of permissions.

## Permissions

We request the following permissions

* Contacts - This allows us to auto-suggest contacts and to allow you to add new senders to contacts via the app
* Photos / Media / Files - This allows you to attach images and save images you receive
* Storage - K-9 needs to store email and attachments to your device in order to work
* Vibration control - We offer the ability to vibrate on receiving an e-mail
* Run at start-up - This allows you to receive e-mail as soon as you turn your device on
* Prevent the device from sleeping - This allows push and poll e-mail to work
* View network connections - This allows us to only make requests when a connection is available
* Read sync settings - This allows us to sync contacts and other information
* Full network access - We need this in order to contact your email server.

More permissions may be added to support new features and development.

# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation section of the K9 Mail website.

This section aims to provide information on current features (and give some pointers on future direction where possible). However as a living project, the section is a constant work-in-progress and is often developed along-side / after the features themselves. 

If you have any comments please feel free to <a href="contribute.md">provide feedback</a>

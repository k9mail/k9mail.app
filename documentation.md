# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation section of the K9 Mail website.

This section aims to document current features (and give some pointers on future direction where possible). However as a living document, the documentation is a constant work-in-progress and is often developed along-side / after the features themselves. If you have any comments please feel free to <a href="contribute.md">provide feedback</a>

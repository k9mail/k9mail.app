# Documentation

## Installation

Once you have obtained the APK file from <a href="download.html">one of the app stores</a> it will be installed automatically. Depending on the version of Android you have you may be prompted to accept K-9's use of permissions

## Permissions

We request the following permissions

* Contacts - This allows us to auto-suggest contacts and to allow you to add new senders to contacts via the app
* Photos / Media / Files - This allows you to attach images and save images you receive
* Storage - K-9 needs to store email and attachments to your device in order to work
* Vibration control - We offer the ability to vibrate on receiving an e-mail
* Run at start-up - This allows you to receive e-mail as soon as you turn your device on
* Prevent the device from sleeping - This allows push and poll e-mail to work
* View network connections - This allows us to only make requests when a connection is available
* Read sync settings - This allows us to sync contacts and other information
* Full network access - We need this in order to contact your email server.

## Initial Set-Up / Welcome Screen

When you first launch K-9 you will be shown a welcome screen giving you a run down of the features and then be prompted to add an account.

## Accounts

K-9 supports three main types of account at present:

* IMAP
* POP3
* WebDAV

The account set-up wizard will launch automatically after the Welcome Screen. For any additional accounts they can be added by going to the accounts menu, and then tapping the 'Add account' option in the overflow menu.

You are then prompted for the email address and password. If K-9 recognises the hostname, the setup will be automatically configured with the typical server connection details. If not, you will be prompted for the account type and then the connection details, including the authentication type.

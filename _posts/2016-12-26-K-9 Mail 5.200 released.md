The K-9 team is happy to announce the availability of **K-9 Mail 5.200**.

It has been over 2 years since the release of the last major version. But we haven't been idle. Have a look at the list
of the most important changes:

* Added support for PGP/MIME
* Added support for bundled notifications on Android 7+ and Android Wear
* New option: only notify for messages from contacts
* Ask for confirmation on "mark all as read"
* Added support for sub-folders (WebDAV)
* Added support for List-Post header
* Added support for Server Name Indication
* Disabled support for SSLv3 protocol/ciphers and all RC4 ciphers
* Removed support for APG (use OpenKeychain instead)
* Added server settings for more providers
* Added translations: Bulgarian, Persian (Farsi), Croatian, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, Serbian
* Lots of smaller bug fixes and features

An often requested feature was the addition of email encryption using the PGP/MIME mechanism. It required us to change a
lot of the internals of K-9 Mail and extend the interface to talk to the [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/)
app that performs the actual encryption. [Vincent Breitmoser](https://github.com/valodim) did most of the work on this.
He was able to work on it full-time for a year thanks to the generous
[funding](https://www.opentech.fund/project/k-9-mail) of the [Open Tech Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/). A huge thank
you to them!

We'd also like to thank the numerous people who contributed bug fixes, new features and translations; especially
[Philip Whitehouse](https://github.com/philipwhiuk) who is the most recent addition to the K-9 team. Another thank you
goes to [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/) for inviting [Dominik Sch√ºrmann](https://www.sufficientlysecure.org/) and
Vincent to come to Berlin for a K-9 Mail hack week with [ligi](https://github.com/ligi) and cketti.

The new version should be available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9) and
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.fsck.k9) shortly. If you can't wait, go [grab the APK from
GitHub](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/releases/tag/5.200).

## Forks

As an open-source project K-9 is occasionally forked by developers wanting to add specific 
features for their personal use or following a difference in design decisions.

On this page we list forks of the project as a guide to alternatives. Occasionally a fork will re-merge with the 
main code-base or useful features be added back to K-9 from a fork.

K-9 itself is a fork of the original Android Open Source Project (AOSP) 'Mail' app.
